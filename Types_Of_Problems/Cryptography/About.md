# Cryptography
You’ll attack poorly implemented crypto, outdated crypto, or use well-known vulnerabilities to attack encrypted messages.You might be given a few RSA keys whose modulus share a factor, and you decrypt a message encrypted by one of these keys. Or you’re given a password database with unsalted password hashes. You could get a cipher, where you can guess some of the plaintext, and use that to figure out the key and decrypt the remainder of the message. Or, it could just be ROT13.
