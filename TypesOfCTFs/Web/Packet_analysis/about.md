# Packet Analysis
You will be given a pcap file {packet capture dump}, and youâ€™ll try to decode, analyze, and interpret it, using tools such as Wireshark.
Questions can be asked on anything - the browser used , the password/username if the user sends it in plaintext or whatever encryption
or listening to a VOIP call without encryption.
