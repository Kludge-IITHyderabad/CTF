[Hopper](https://www.hopperapp.com/tutorial.html) - disassemble, decompile and debug (OS X only) your 32/64bits executables.  
[IDA Pro Demo](https://out7.hex-rays.com/demo/request) - smartest and most feature-full disassembler  
[gdb](http://www.sourceware.org/gdb/) - allows you to see what is going on `inside' another program while it executes / when it crashed.  

When source code is not available use - [GEF](https://github.com/hugsy/gef) [peda](https://code.google.com/archive/p/peda/) [voltron](https://github.com/snare/voltron) as GDB is intended for debugging source code, not stripped binaries without symbols and debugging information.
