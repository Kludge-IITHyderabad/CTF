## What are CTFs?
CTFs are computer security/hacking competitions which generally consist of participants breaking, investigating, reverse engineering and doing anything they can to reach the end goal, a "flag" which is usually found as a string of text.Finding this flag is proof that you solved the puzzle, and submitting it to the scoreboard earns your team points.Flags are very distinctive so they are easy to find if you do come across one.
