# General Tips
You can solve the puzzles solo but doing the same with a team is much more fun. For any CTF there will be multiple challenges open, so that everyone can work on their own as well as collaborate :)

Google as much as you can.

You might get stuck at some problems which is fine. You can contact the author/fellow contestants for help.You might glearn about a few more resources or you could check if you are on the right path.

Take a Break or solve a different problem if you are still stuck.

Be thorough with Linux commands like [grep](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ugrep.htm), [file](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ufile.htm), [strings](http://www.linfo.org/strings.html), [uniq](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/uuniq.htm), [sed](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/used.htm), [awk](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/uawk.htm).

Set up to run VMs so that you can use Windows or linux or (whatever the problem requires) / (u prefer).

Keep an eye for Buffer Overflow(like [Integer Overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow)).
